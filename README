Win10Pcap is a new WinPcap-based Ethernet packet capture library.

Win10Pcap works with Windows 10. Win10Pcap has the binary-compatibility
with the original WinPcap DLLs. You can run Wireshark or other
WinPcap-compatible applications with Win10Pcap by simply installing
Win10Pcap DLLs, instead of original WinPcap.

WHAT'S DIFFERENT WITH ORIGINAL WINPCAP?
---------------------------------------

Original WinPcap http://www.winpcap.org/ is a great packet capture
library. However, WinPcap is based on the NDIS 5.x driver model.

We integrated the WinPcap codes into the NDIS 6.x driver model
to work stably with Windows 10. We also added the code to support
the capability to capture IEEE802.1Q VLAN tags in Ethernet frames
which the original WinPcap has not supported.
